# Alexandria

Alexandria is a Blockchain project that seeks to unlock the doors of science to those researchers who cannot afford to pay the fees of people who are enriched with the academic papers of the scientific community.

Alexandria uses the technology of IPFS and Ethereum to create a network of academic articles that are shared free of charge and licensed by CC.

## History 

The idea of Alexandria was born in the BSIC hackathon of the 2017.

Our team is currently meeting every week in the Google Campus of Madrid.
