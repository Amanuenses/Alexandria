## Problem we are adressing

The **current science distribution model** was developed in a time without Internet. In the past, the only way to access state of the art knowledge was to subscribe to specialized academic journals, but nowadays this model is obsolete. The publishing process is extremely slow, sometimes during years in which the authors of a paper can not share their scientific advances with the community until the article is not published. This **obstructs the access to knowledge, instead of promoting it**.

This model is only serving the interests of big publishing oligarchies, not the interests of society and the scientific community. This distribution model is so unfair, that publishers usually get the scientific papers and reviews for free from their authors, meanwhile they charge scientists, institutions and people to access those papers.

Many are the challenges that science distribution faces today, from providing open access to knowledge, to use alternative metrics for measuring the quality of science.

Using the Internet as a distribution platform and Blockchain technology to enable distributed governance and remove intermediaries, we aim to change the way science is distributed today. Concretely, we aim to use the IlnterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as an open, distributed, and non-censurable **channel to share scientific papers**; and develop an Ethereum Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) to enable a **distributed peer-review process** in which trusted reviewers can accept, propose changes and reject papers, being the accepted papers "published" in the DAO's distributed journal.

This approach enables open access by default, makes the peer review and publication process easier and faster, removing intermediaries such as publishers, and makes the process entirely transparent. Moreover, by changing the distribution model, the production model is also challenged. Making the distribution and evaluation of science easier may encourage new models of production similar to open-source, in which the knowledge is not considered static and it is easy for external contributors to propose enhancements.

## Why is Blockchain needed to solve this problem?

With Blockchain technology we can develop Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that replace traditional journals in the peer review and publishing process. The gobernace of these journals will be defined by the DAO's source code in Ethereum.

The DAOs will transparently define their rules, such as the number of favorable peer-reviews needed for a paper to be published, or who are the people that can decide if the paper is in the scope of the journal.

Thus, scientific community will be able to publish and access peer-reviewed papers without any cost. Moreover, anyone can create their own journal with custom gobernace rules to publish scientific knowledge.

The knowledge stored in these DAOs will be permanent, incensorable and globally accesible for everyone.

## What is the size of the market?

According to a recent European Comission report, the total market size of Academic Publishing and Open Access publising are:

  - Academic publishing: $10 billion / year
  - Open Access: $500 million / year

## Other solutions currently in use

Many solutions have been proposed to provide open access to knowledge and to improve the publishing and distribution of science. Currently, an article can be distributed as open access by Green or Gold Open Access (OA) models. In Green OA, authors share their work in an open repository (such as CiteSeer, arXiv, PubMed Central) provided they have the rights to do so (usually only a preprint version can be shared due to copyright transfers required by publishers). Gold open access provides free access while charging authors, subscribers or founders or by relying in other business models such as advertisement. Both traditional (e.g. Elsevier) and new publishers and journals (e.g. PLOSS) provide open access for science publication. However both Green and Gold models make profit out of knowledge publication, either by charging for the final versions in Green OA model or charging the authors or making profit with other business models in Gold OA model. Open access to knowledge is also being promoted through sharing access to papers (either open access or not) with tools such as sci-hub.cc. These solutions are however accused of copyright infringement and have been blocked in some countries. Online and continuous publication by which journals publish their accepted papers online as soon as they are ready without waiting for the journal issue to be finished are strategies that traditional publishers use to improve the publication time. However, to our knowledge there have been no attempts to grant open access through peer to peer technology by the journal/publishers or to provide transparency and efficiency in the peer review and publication processes through Blockchain technology.
