- [ ] Define specific problem you're addressing

Science distribution model was developed for a time without Internet, where the best way to access state of the art knowledge was to subscribe to an specialized academic journal. Nowadays, this model is not only extremely slow but also obstructs access to knowledge instead of promoting it and serves the interests of big publishing oligarchies instead of the interests of society and scientific community. The distribution model is so unfair that publishers takes scientific papers and reviews for free from scientists and public institutions, and then charges those scientists, institutions and people to access those papers. Many are the challenges that science distribution faces today, from providing open access to knowledge to use alternative metrics to measure the quality of science.

Using the Internet as distribution platform, and Blockchain technology to remove intermediaries and enable distributed governance we aim to change the way science is distributed today. Concretely, we aim to use the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) as an open, distributed, and non censurable channel to share scientific papers; and develop an Ethereum Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) to enable a distributed peer-review process in which trusted reviewers can accept, propose changes or reject a paper, being the accepted papers "published" in the DAO's distributed journal.

With this approach, not only we enable open access by default, but also remove intermediaries such as publishers and make the peer review and publication process easier and fast, while making it fully transparent. Moreover, by changing the distribution model, the production model is also challenged; if it is easier than ever to distribute and evaluate science, are static papers the best way to communicate science?.

- [ ] Why is Blockchain needed to solve this problem?

With Blockchain technology we can develop a Distributed Autonomous Organization that substitutes a traditional journal in the peer review and publishing process. These distributed journals could transparently define the rules governing it, such as the number of peer-review accepts needed for a paper to be published or who are the people that can decide if the paper is in the scope of the journal. Thus, scientific community will be able to publish and access peer-reviewed papers without paying for access or publish. Moreover, the quality of the journal will be defined by the distributed journal rules to decide if a paper is accepted, and other governance rules such as the review process maximum time could be enforced with Blockchain technologies.


- [ ] What is the size of the market?

According to a recent European Comission report, the total market size of Academic Publishing and Open Access publising are:

  - Academic publishing: $10 billion / year
  - Open Access: $500 million / year

- [ ] What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem? (other companies, workarounds, systems or processes that can compete with or substitute your product)

    Many solutions have been proposed to provide open access to knowledge and to improve the publishing and distribution of science. Currently, an article can be distributed as open access by Green or Gold Open Access (OA) models. In Green OA, authors share their work in an open repository (such as CiteSeer, arXiv, PubMed Central) provided they have the rights to do so (usually only a preprint version can be shared due to copyright transfers required by publishers). Gold open access provides free access while charging authors, subscribers or founders or by relying in other business models such as advertisement. Both traditional (e.g. Elsevier) and new publishers and journals (e.g. PLOSS) provide open access for science publication. However both Green and Gold models make profit out of knowledge publication, either by charging for the final versions in Green OA model or charging the authors or making profit with other business models in Gold OA model. Open access to knowledge is also being promoted through sharing access to papers (either open access or not) with tools such as sci-hub.cc. These solutions are however accused of copyright infringement and have been blocked in some countries. Online and continuous publication by which journals publish their accepted papers online as soon as they are ready without waiting for the journal issue to be finished are strategies that traditional publishers use to improve the publication time. However, to our knowledge there have been no attempts to grant open access through peer to peer technology by the journal/publishers or to provide transparency and efficiency in the peer review and publication processes through Blockchain technology.
