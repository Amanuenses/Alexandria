## Who are your clients/users? (persona of your user)

- The whole **scientific comunity**, interested in the open access and difussion of science.
- Citizens (Open Access to knowledge) including disenpowered communities that cannot currently afford the access to scientific knowdledge
- Institutions: cheaper access to Journals
- Innovation actors such as startups, research and development organizations, etc. Having a cheap and quick access to new knowledge


## What are their pain points?
- Time to publish
- no transparent processes
- Who review the reviewers?
- Accreditation through JCR

## What is your product's value proposition?
-

## What is your distribution and go-to-market strategy? Who can you partner with?
- Academic institututions such as universities.
- Researchers
- Research groups
- (new?) Open Access Journals

## What are the risks associated with your solution?
- Monpolistic strategies against our journals (JCR, the defacto standard, is produced by a Status Quo company affected by the project)
- Risk aversion of researchers, that will not send papers unless impact is likelly
- Big inertia of Academia and Academic Publihing, that could not be ready for big changes

## What is the impact of your solution? How will it be measured?
- Provide a new supply chain for science ditribution that removes intermediaries and improve efficiency while enabling innovation in the research publication processes and workflows.
- Increase the number of Open Access Journals
- Break the vapirism chain of the editors who benefit with other people's work.

## Define the technical specifications and development roadmap
Proof of concept:
- Develop a sample contract in Ethereum with the gobernance models
    - Test the contract
    - Review the contract rules
    - Review contract security
- Develop the IPFS required to submit the papers

First descentralized journal:
- DOJÃ´DOT first submission
    - Create the contract in Ethereum
    - Upload a sample paper to IFPS
    - Submit the IFPS hash to the contract


## Define your impact criteria and how you measure it

- \# of decentralized journals using this contract
- \# of authors
- \# of submissions
- \# of reviewers
- \# of peers sharing papers
- \# impact factor of journals
- \# time of response of journals
- \# perceived quality of Journal vs traditional Journals  (Through formulaires)
