## Prototype of the Solution

Two developments constitute the prototype of the solution proposed by Alexandria:

 1. Ethereum Distributed Autonomous Journal contract. An Ethereum contract governing a distributed journal have been developed to show the information architecture and logic behind our proposal. [The Solidity code](https://github.com/Amanuenses/Alexandria/tree/master/Contracts) can be found in our GitHub. Following figure illustrate the approach followed to develop the proposal.

 2. Several paper mockups. Paper mockups are great tools to test the Minimum Viable Product proposed by a project. Focusing in our three target users: Editors, Authors and reviewers. We have developed a user interface to serve each of these users during their publishing user journeys. This mockups will be developed further once the test have validated them into working code (Web App) linked to the Ethereum Distributed Autonomous Journal previously described.

## Testing the Minimum Viable Product

We have developed two strategies to test our MVP.

### Video campaign: the Whiteboard animation
First, we are going to launch a marketing campaign consisting of a whiteboard animation explaining the problems scientific publication faces today and how our tool tries to solve them. Then, the funneling of the conversions between the number of video views, the number of landing page visits and the number of subscriptions to the project news will be measured. Thus, with this marketing campaign we aim to validate the proposal, the target user that is more interested and develop a first list of potential early adopters.

The [script of the video](https://github.com/Amanuenses/Alexandria/blob/master/video/script.md) can be found in our GitHub repository.

### Paper Mock up: The three target user interfaces

Following the approach of fail cheap, fail often to learn as fast as possible, we have developed three mockups of the user interfaces of our product. One for each target user (authors, editors and reviewers). This mockups will be based in the user journeys of the user. They will be tested and transformed iteratively with user feedback to finally be connected with the Ethereum contract of a Distributed Journal once validated.
