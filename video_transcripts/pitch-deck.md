## Video Intro

For centuries, researchers have been sharing their work in specialized journals. These journals have collected the last discoveries provided by the scientific community around the world in each field. Other scientists of the field assessed the quality of the submissions before publication, by the so-called, peer review.

This has been the method in which science has spread. Journals issues have been released in a regular basis with compilations of peer-reviewed papers and sent to interested subscribers.

But this system has become obsolete with the growth of the Internet. Digital journals are mimicking the same processes printed journals were using centuries ago, although the access to scientific knowledge could be much faster and cheaper. Nowadays, access to papers is really expensive both for readers and authors. Furthermore, scientific publication and peer-reviewing is as slow as it was before the Internet era.

So, we wonder:

   * What if science distribution could be free? Nor authors nor reviewers make money from it, so why should publishers do?
   * What if we had a faster peer review process? How could we give Journals and Authors warranties about the maximum review time?
   * What if reviewers were reviewed? How can we give value to good reviews and avoid the immunity to critic of non-fair anonymous reviews?
   * What if all those things helped authors and journals to produce free and open science?

We want to explore these ideas using the tools of tomorrow for today's science. We are building Alexandria.

# Presentation

## Why (~Vision)

Right now publishers are monopolizing science dissemination and making a huge profit by taking advantage of authors, reviewers and readers. Publishing is currently a never-ending, expensive process that harms science and slows down the dissemination of knowledge.

We are ready to change this! We dream of a distributed science publication system, where having middlemen such as traditional publishers no longer makes sense.

## How (~Mission + Solution)

Through disruptive distributed technologies such as Blockchain, we both enable decentralization and relieve the pains of traditional publication processes.

This is accomplished by providing a reputation system of peer reviewers that will improve quality and ensure faster reviews and distribution, helping editors, reviewers and authors.

### Editors & Journals

Editors and journals will be able to find the best peer reviewers in their fields of interest, and those that respond quickly. Thus reducing time-to-publish and publishing costs.

### Reviewers

Reviewers will finally have their work recognized.

### Authors

Authors will be able to submit papers to time-responsive, free, open access journals, and forget about slow, unfair and unnacountable anonymous reviews.

## Technologies(?)

Our solution relies on blockchain and IPFS technologies.
 - We use BlockChain for the creation of a decentralized reputation system and distributed autonomous journals,
 - and IPFS for the distribution of content, such as papers and reviews.

### BlockChain & Ethereum

Our proposal is implemented as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that governs the peer-review process for each journal. These Ditributed Autonomous Journals enable this processes in a decentralized manner:

- Paper submissions
- Assign reviewers to papers
- Receive and rate reviews

### IPFS

The content is distributed using IPFS, a decentralized file storage and distribution system. This reduce storage cost, provides a secure access method and ensures that the content remains accessible after the journal’s death.

## Value of market (10B)

According to a recent European Comission report, the total market size of Academic Publishing and Open Access publishing are 10 Bn USD and .5 Bn USD per year, respectively.

Our goal is to challange a market supported by old technologies and established oligopolies with decentralized disruptive technologies. This opens new opportunities for many new open access distributed journals, challenging business models built upon unneeded intermediaries.

## Business model

Unlike traditional publishers, our business model relies on providing real value to journals.

- Our technology is open source and free to access by anyone, as we believe science must be.
- We offer paid migration services for journals just in case they need them.
- A commission on the subscriptions and donations to journals is charged if journals want updates and support.

## Growth strategy

### Start
The development of the project starts with the resources developed at the hackathon:

1. A marketing campaign relying on a promotional video
2. Working prototypes of the proposal developed for each of our target users: (Journal editors, reviewers and authors)

With which we will:
- build our first community of early adopters
- Get our first metrics
- Validate and iterate our product

photo: seeds

### Network growth

Afterwards, the development will continue with a campaign for building further our user base.

Our strategy is then to build a strong network of reviewers exploring partnerships with reviewers and authors’ communities, journals and institutions.

### Critical mass

New and existing Open Science Journals can then directly benefit from our reputation network of reviewers, where they will find the best and fastest reviewers with ease. 

Reviewers with a strong profile in the network will also introduce the tool to new journals in order to improve their reputation in the system.

Our time-to-review warranties are though to attract authors and journals, which can convince each other of the convenience of the use of our network.

### Mature Technology

Once a strong network of reviewers is built, science publication will be faster and peer-review process transparent and accountable. The need of traditional publishers and even editors will be questioned by the fast and cheap publication of our distributed technology and the possibility of creating fully autonomous journals.

Once the technology is stablished, we want to deploy the first fully autonomous distributed journals, without the need of journal editors. Their behaviour will be 100% coded in the Blockchain.

Finally, we aim to become the cornerstone of a new generation of open distributed science publication systems.

## Impact

With our distributed reputation system of reviewers, we are ready to improve review time and quality from the first usage. Once our system is perceived as the best way to improve the speed of peer review processes, improve reviews quality and enable free open science publication we expect that a wide proportion of tech-savy Open Access Journals will use our system.

We believe that the Blockchain enabled solutions for science publication will suppose a change comparable with the introduction of the press.

Ideas:
- Necesidad de cambio: ninguno de los contribuyentes reales que "hacen ciencia" se beneficia con el proceso actual
- Los autores tendrán la esperanza de que este proceso sea mejor y que sus artículos rechazados en otros journals o sujetos a largas esperas para publicar vean la luz mucho más rápido
- Los reviewers siempre son anónimos y su trabajo no se reconoce. Añadiendo open badges para reconocer sus méritos les incitará a realizar revisiones en sus ámbitos de especialidad

# Elevator Pitch

Right now there are publishers who are vampirizing science. It is expensive and also slow! We are building a distributed reputation system for science publication, review and distribution. 

Thus, we are offering (triangulo): (TODO Reescibir editors/authors/reviewers/readers will benefit from...)
    
 - Journal editors will benefit form a reviewer reputation system. for **journal editors** to find the best reviewers for a paper who respond in a timely manner. 
 - Authors will benefit from... submit papers knowing that they will be reviewed quickly
 - Reviewers will finally see their work valued. 
 - Readers will benefit from... can access openly all the papers and reviews published through this system with no fees.

The change of paradigm in science distribution using Blockchain is comparable to the change introduced by the print. 

With your help, we will change .

# Roadmap

- Write a whitepaper
- Review the Ethereum contract
- Create a node with IPFS and Ethereum
- Deploy the contract 
- Change the science paradigm

# Impact

- Provide a new supply chain for science ditribution that removes intermediaries and improves efficiency while enabling innovation in the research publication processes and workflows.
- Increase the number of Open Access Journals.
- Break the vampirist chain of publishers who benefits from other people's work.


# Market Opportunity

According to a recent European Comission report, the total market size of Academic Publishing and Open Access publising are:

  - Academic publishing: $10 billion / year
  - Open Access: $500 million / year

We are aiming to change a market supported by old technologies and established oligopolies with decentralized disruptive technologies. This opens new opportunities for many new open access distributed journals, challenging business models built upon unneeded intermediaries.

# Why blockchain

With Blockchain technology we can develop Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that replace traditional journals in the peer review and publishing process. The governace of these journals will be defined by the DAO's source code in Ethereum.

The DAOs will transparently define their rules, such as the number of favorable peer-reviews needed for a paper to be published, or who are the people that can decide if the paper is in the scope of the journal.

Thus, scientific community will be able to publish and access peer-reviewed papers without any cost. Moreover, anyone can create their own journal with custom governace rules to publish scientific knowledge.

The knowledge stored in these DAOs will be permanent, incensorable and globally accessible to everyone.

# Problems we are solving



# Competitors

## Previous competitors text:
Many solutions have been proposed to provide open access to knowledge and to improve the publishing and distribution of science. There are two open-access distribution models, Green Open Access and Gold Open Access. On the one hand, authors using Green Open Access model share their work in an open repository (such as CiteSeer, arXiv, PubMed Central), but they can only share the work they have the rights of (usually only preprint versions). On the other hand, Gold Open Access provides free access to the content, while authors, subscribers, advertisers or founders are charged.

Both traditional and new publishers and journals (e.g. Elsevier and PLOSS, respectively) provide open access for science publication. However, both Green and Gold models make profit out of knowledge publication, either by charging for the final versions, or, alternatively, by charging the authors or making profit with other business models.

Open access to knowledge is also being promoted through sharing access to papers (either open access or not) with tools such as sci-hub.cc. These solutions are, however, accused of copyright infringement, and have been blocked in some countries.

Regarding publication speed, journals are beginning to adopt online and continuous publication to deliver accepted papers online as soon as they are ready. Using this approach, authors do not have to wait for other journal papers to be finished in order to publish the entire issue.

However, to our knowledge, there have been no attempts to grant open access through peer-to-peer technology by the journal/publishers or to provide transparency and efficiency in the peer review and publication processes through Blockchain technologies.

# Business model

Alexandria is developed from scientists to scientists. Scietists have their own ways to fund their projects, and don't need bussiness models.
